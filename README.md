## Description

A portfolio site to highlight deployed projects and coding proficiencies.

In building the site, I wanted to highlight some key elements:

- Accessibility: Included alt text for all images.
- Responsiveness: Added code to ensure the site would display properly on all device types.
- Scalability: Designed the site to allow for future projects to be easily added as the portfolio grows.

I used warm colors to give the site a friendly, approachable feel. I added a recent photo of me that had a warm tone to it as well.
